# Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas

A real-time collaborative whiteboard application where multiple users can draw on the same canvas simultaneously. The application synchronizes strokes, cursor positions, and undo/redo operations across all connected users using WebSockets.

## Features

- Brush and Eraser tools
- Adjustable color and stroke size
- Real-time drawing synchronization
- Remote cursor indicators with usernames
- Global Undo/Redo across all users
- Multiple rooms/boards (shareable via unique link)
- Online user presence indicator
- Works on desktop & touch devices

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### 2. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
This runs:
Vite dev server for the frontend at http://localhost:5173/
WebSocket server at ws://localhost:3000/ws

##  Testing with Multiple Users

### 1. Open a Board
Open a drawing board by navigating to a unique board URL, for example:
```bash
http://localhost:5173/board/ABC123
```
### 2. Share the Link
- Copy the link and open it:
- In another browser, OR
- In private/incognito mode, OR
- On your phone (connected to the same Wi-Fi network)

### 3. Start Drawing
Draw on both screens — your strokes should sync in real time across all connected clients.

```




## Known Limitations / Future Improvements

- Strokes are stored in memory (not persistent after server restart).
- No authentication — usernames are local to the browser.
- Performance may degrade with extremely large stroke history.
- Undo/Redo is global per board (not per-user stack).

|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| Canvas Rendering & Drawing Logic          | ~4 hours   |
| WebSocket Sync + Cursor Presence          | ~3 hours   |
| Undo/Redo Global State Handling           | ~2 hours   |
| Room Management + Sharable Links          | ~2 hours |

## Project Goal

This project was built to demonstrate:
- Efficient canvas drawing & incremental rendering
- Real-time event streaming over WebSockets
- Shared global state synchronization (undo/redo)
- Room-based collaboration architecture
- Clean, maintainable TypeScript without frameworks
